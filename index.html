		<p><strong>Iron Man</srtong> who under all the armor is Tony Stark, a brilliant engineer.

		His ability to fly and shoot beams of energy from his hands and chest help him defeat his foes.
		The suit protects him from damage and gives him superhuman strength. Tony has adapted to challenges 
		he has faced to over come even the most challenging tasks due to his true genius nature. </p>
