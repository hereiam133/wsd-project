				<p><strong>Iron Man</strong> who under all the armor is Tony Stark, a brilliant engineer.
				He created his suit to protect him and to give him extra ordinary strength and powers.
				His ability to fly and shoot beams of energy from his hands and chest help him defeat his foes.
				The suit protects him from damage and gives him superhuman strength. Tony has adapted to challenges 
				he has faced to over come even the most challenging tasks due to his true genius nature. </p>

				<p>Tony's upcomming role as a member of the Avengers will surely be exciting and if the movies 
				stay true to the comics, Tony and the iron suit will be come one. He will have to use his most
				powerful weapon to survive, his mind. Soon we shall hopefully see Tony and the iron suit truly 
				become <span id="make_red">Iron Man</span>.</p>

				<p>Iron man the movie is great for a number of reasons. To start it helps to bring
				the comic books to life. It actually allows you to enjoy the comic books even more
				because now you have an even greater picture painted in your mind. That is again all 
				thanks to the movies. Hopefully they stick on the path they have started as it is a 
				great addition to the comic with impressive visuals to spark anyone's mind.</p>

			<h2>About The Site</h2>
				<section class="column">
			<p>A billionaire playboy, industrialist and ingenious engineer, Stark suffers a severe 
			chest injury during a kidnapping in which his captors attempt to force him to build a 
			weapon of mass destruction. He instead creates a powered suit of armor to save his life 
			and escape captivity. He later uses the suit to protect the world as Iron Man. Through 
			his multinational corporation ― Stark Industries ― Tony has created many military weapons, 
			some of which, along with other technological devices of his making, have been integrated 
			into his suit, helping him fight crime. Initially, Iron Man was a vehicle for Stan Lee to 
			explore Cold War themes, particularly the role of American technology and business in the 
			fight against communism. Subsequent re-imaginings of Iron Man have transitioned from Cold 
			War themes to contemporary concerns, such as corporate crime and terrorism.</p>
